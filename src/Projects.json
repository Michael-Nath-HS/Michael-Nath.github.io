                "description": "From March 2019 to April 2020, I worked in a molecular biology research lab at John Jay College for Criminal Justice, investigating the relationship between green tea compounds and microRNAs associated with breast cancer. Through conducting this research, I have become specialized in molecular biology datasets, proficient in handling lab equipment, and have developed effective communicating skills for use in experiment formulation.",

I constructed fundamental algorithms in the field, leveraging paradigms such as clustering heuristics and dynamic programing. My team’s final project: “Computationally Locating Transcription Factor Binding Regions” won “Best Final Project” among 12 teams in the camp and was featured in Dr. Phillip Compeau’s online course: “Multiscale Biological Modeling”.",
